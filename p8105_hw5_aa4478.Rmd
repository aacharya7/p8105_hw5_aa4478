```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
	fig.width = 6, 
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)
theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))
options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colour = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)
scale_colour_discrete = scale_colour_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d
```
## Problem 1 - Read and clean the data 

```{r cars}
homicide_data = 
  read.csv("./data/homicide-data.csv") %>%
  mutate(
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ "solved"
    ),
    city_state = str_c(city,state,sep = "_")
  ) %>%
  select(city_state, resolved) %>%
  filter(city_state !="Tulsa AL")
```

Aggregate
```{r}
agg_df = 
  homicide_data %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```







## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
